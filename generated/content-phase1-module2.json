          "content": "## Intimate Partner Sexual Violence\n\nWhile Hollywood often depicts sexual assault as a stranger in a ski mask who lunges out to pull a complete stranger into a dark alley, in reality, most sexual assault is committed by someone the survivor knows.\n\n**According to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center (NSVRC):**\n\n- More than half (51.1%) of female survivors of rape reported being raped by an intimate partner and 40.8% by an acquaintance\n- For male survivors, more than half (52.4%) reported being raped by an acquaintance\n- For both men and women, being assaulted by a known individual makes up more than half of the cases reported\n\n### Module Learning Objectives\n\nIn the first module, you examined intimate partner violence and the use of power and control in abusive relationships. On the outer ring of the Power and Control Wheel are physical and sexual violence. The threat of violence can be terrorizing, and the use of sexual violence can be particularly traumatizing.\n\nThe intersection between sexual violence and intimate partner violence is more common than you might think, and to understand this intersection, you must understand the basis of sexual violence.\n\n**By the end of this module you will be able to:**\n\n- Distinguish between consent, compliance, coercion, rape, and other forms of sexual assault\n- Identify ways society normalizes violence against women\n- Describe how sexual violence connects to intimate partner violence"

          "content": "## Understanding Consent\n\nThe spectrum of consent includes four areas: **consent, compliance, coercion**, and **rape/assault**. A large portion of understanding sexual violence is understanding consent and what lack of consent looks like.\n\n### Consent\n\n**True consent is:**\n- Freely given without pressure or coercion\n- Informed - with full awareness of what is being agreed to\n- Enthusiastic - not reluctant or hesitant\n- Ongoing - can be withdrawn at any time\n- Specific - consent to one thing doesn't mean consent to everything\n\n### Compliance\n\n**Compliance means:**\n- Going along with something without true enthusiasm\n- May involve pressure, obligation, or social expectations\n- Not the same as freely given consent\n- In healthy relationships, occasional compliance may occur, but it should not be the norm\n\n### Coercion\n\n**Coercion involves:**\n- Pressure, threats, or manipulation to obtain sexual activity\n- Creating a sense of obligation or guilt\n- Using position of power or authority\n- Threatening consequences if someone doesn't comply\n- When coercion is present, true consent cannot be given\n\n### Rape/Assault\n\n**Rape and sexual assault are:**\n- Any sexual act without consent\n- Sexual activity obtained through force or threat of force\n- Sexual contact when someone cannot consent (incapacitated, unconscious, etc.)\n- A serious crime and violation of a person's autonomy\n\n### A Note About Gender\n\nWhen reviewing the research and history of sexual violence, it is largely a story of men's violence against women. Unfortunately, that also means that most of the research that has been done does not include research about survivors who are men, transgender, or non-binary. This data will be included where possible throughout the course."

As the consent spectrum shows, however, consent isn't always easy to understand. Many people struggle with knowing when someone can and cannot consent.\n\n**Social Definitions:**\n\nIn a social context, consent should be enthusiastic, informed, freely given, and ongoing. If any of these elements are missing, consent is questionable or absent.\n\n**Legal Definitions:**\n\nWhile social understanding helps us recognize what consent looks like, legal definitions of consent and sexual assault don't always match the social definition. Laws also vary between states and territories, which can make it that much harder to understand.\n\n### How to Respond\n\n**For this reason, it is important to always respond to survivors of rape and sexual assault based on their social and lived experiences.**\n\nThis means that if a survivor has any of the actions defined across the consent spectrum used against them, and they consider themselves to have experienced sexual assault, then we should believe and support them.\n\nAs professionals like Dr. Patel or James, your role is not to determine legal definitions—it's to provide trauma-informed support based on the survivor's experience and needs."

          "content": "## Rape and Sexual Assault in the Context of Intimate Partner Violence\n\nMost sexual assault is committed by someone the survivor knows. This is often referred to as **acquaintance rape**, but if you were asked to name an acquaintance, you might think of a classmate, a coworker, or a friend—not someone with whom you're in a long-term relationship or someone to whom you are married.\n\n**According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence:**\n\n- It's estimated that between **10% and 14%** of married women will be raped at some point during their marriages\n- Marital rape is the **most underreported** form of sexual assault\n\n### The Reality of Intimate Partner Sexual Violence\n\nIntimate partner violence can include sexual assault. This can be both surprising and confusing to the public and even to individuals new to working with survivors. In fact, this concept is still presented as shocking news in popular culture and media.\n\n**The truth is that intimate partner sexual assault:**\n\n- Happens to people of all races, genders, ages, social classes, ethnicities, and abilities\n- Occurs when the person causing harm uses sexual assault or rape as a means of exerting control over the survivor\n- Is used to intimidate, control, and demean survivors of domestic violence\n\n### Prevalence\n\nIntimate partner sexual violence is far more common than you might think:\n\n- Between **40% and 45%** of women in abusive relationships will also be sexually assaulted during the course of the relationship\n- Only **36%** of all rape survivors ever report the crime to the police\n- The percentage of married women who report a spousal rape to the police is even lower\n- Women who are sexually abused by intimate partners report **more risk factors for intimate partner homicides** than non-sexually abused women"

          "content": "## Using Intimate Partner Sexual Violence for Power and Control\n\nWhen intimate partner sexual violence is present in an abusive relationship, it is often used alongside other types of abuse on the Power and Control Wheel. It can be physical, visual, or verbal, and take place individually or in any combination.\n\n### How Sexual Violence Manifests Across the Wheel\n\n**On the Outer Ring (Physical and Sexual Violence):**\n- Forced sexual contact\n- Rape and sexual assault\n- Physical violence during or related to sex\n\n**Connected to Inner Sections:**\n\n- **Using Intimidation:** Threatening sexual violence; making them afraid through sexual gestures or actions\n- **Using Emotional Abuse:** Calling them sexually degrading names; making them feel sexually inadequate\n- **Using Isolation:** Controlling their sexuality; preventing them from seeing friends who might notice abuse\n- **Minimizing/Denying/Blaming:** Saying the sexual assault didn't happen; claiming they wanted it; blaming them for \"causing\" it\n- **Using Coercion and Threats:** Threatening to rape them; threatening to be unfaithful; pressuring for unwanted sexual acts\n\n### The Punishment Dynamic\n\nIn other words, if the survivor doesn't respond to the threats, abusive behaviors, or emotional abuse in a way that makes the person causing harm feel empowered or in control, the abuser may see sexual assault as a punishment for the survivor.\n\nThe way this threat is communicated can vary:\n- Explicit graphic explanations of what the abuser intends to do\n- Implied threats paired with other behaviors\n- Part of a larger pattern of control and coercion"

          "content": "## Barriers to Identifying Intimate Partner Sexual Violence\n\nIntimate partner sexual violence carries many of the same impacts as domestic violence and sexual violence individually, but also has a number of unique challenges that can impact survivors.\n\n### Common Barriers:\n\n**Conceptual Barriers:**\n- The survivor may view sex as a \"spousal duty\"\n- Assuming that being in a relationship means passive consent to all future sex\n- This intersection of rape and sex can cause survivors to classify their experience as \"sex\" instead of \"violence\"\n- Difficulty reconciling love for the partner with the harm the partner has caused\n- Hesitance to define someone they love as a \"rapist\"\n\n**Legal and Social Barriers:**\n- Until 1976, state laws specifically **exempted spousal rape** from general rape laws\n- It wasn't until **1993** that all fifty states had repealed their spousal rape exemptions\n- Many states still continued to treat marital rape differently than non-marital rape\n- Even now, some states legally consider marital rape as a lesser crime than non-marital rape\n\n### Supporting Survivors\n\nWhen engaging with a survivor of sexual assault who has chosen to disclose their experience to you, it is a signal that they believe you can be trusted.\n\n**Critical Response Elements:**\n\n- **Listen to them** without judgment\n- **Continue to build trust** through your actions and words\n- **Maintain an environment of safety and confidentiality**\n- There may be several reasons they are uncomfortable disclosing full details—and that's okay\n- If you provide an environment where they feel safe, heard, and believed, survivors are more likely to share their experiences and be receptive to recommendations for support and services\n\n### Survivor Reactions\n\nThere is no right way for a survivor to react to being sexually assaulted by their partner. Some common reactions include:\n\n- Fear they won't be believed\n- Wondering if it's their fault\n- Feeling alone or not sure who they can talk to\n- PTSD symptoms (dissociation, flashbacks, nightmares)\n- Feeling emotionally numb and detached from other people\n- Difficulty remembering aspects of the event\n- Increased use of alcohol and/or illicit drugs\n- Self-harm\n\nA survivor's response to their experience can impact how and when they may disclose sexual assault, if at all. People who cause harm often know this and may use these reactions or feelings to further the abuse—using insults, demeaning language, or threats to make the survivor feel ashamed and keep them isolated from support systems."
