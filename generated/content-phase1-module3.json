It's normal to want to help someone who has entrusted you with their experience, but it is important to know how to respond in ways that will be supportive to the survivor.\n\n**By the end of this module you will be able to:**\n\n- Identify reasons why leaving an abusive relationship can be difficult for survivors\n- Recognize messages that are harmful to survivors of intimate partner violence\n- Determine ways to respond to someone experiencing intimate partner violence\n\n### The Importance of Listening\n\nListening to survivors is critical in understanding the problem that people experiencing intimate partner violence face. Survivors like Rebel explain the challenges they faced and the ripple effect that victimization can have on family members and the community at large.\n\nPay particular attention to how survivors talk about the abuse they experienced and their difficulty recognizing it as intimate partner violence. As you can see from survivor accounts, abuse does not fit neatly into a single box, which can make it hard for people to identify the abuse happening to them.\n\n**There is no one who understands the impact of intimate partner violence more than a survivor who has experienced it, but it can be helpful for them to know that they are not alone in this experience and the abuse is not their fault.**"

          "content": "## Messages That Are NOT Helpful, but Survivors Often Hear\n\nIf you have ever encountered a survivor of intimate partner violence, you will have probably heard horror stories about the ways individuals have tried to \"help\" them or \"give advice.\" Friends, colleagues, relatives, community members, and even people causing harm themselves have been known to offer what they thought was helpful information, but was actually harmful information, to individuals in an abusive relationship.\n\n### Common Harmful Messages:\n\n**\"Why don't you just leave?\"**\n- This places responsibility on the survivor to stop the violence\n- It ignores the many barriers to leaving\n- It fails to acknowledge that leaving is the most dangerous time\n\n**\"It can't be that bad if you're still there\"**\n- This minimizes the survivor's experience\n- It doesn't recognize the complex dynamics of abuse\n- It suggests the survivor is exaggerating\n\n**\"You just need to stand up for yourself\"**\n- This ignores the power imbalance that defines IPV\n- It suggests the abuse is the survivor's fault for not being strong enough\n- It doesn't recognize that resistance can increase danger\n\n**\"I would never put up with that\"**\n- This is judgmental and creates shame\n- It suggests the survivor is weak or making bad choices\n- It fails to recognize that anyone can experience IPV\n\n**\"What did you do to make them so angry?\"**\n- This directly blames the survivor for the abuse\n- It suggests abuse is a justified response to behavior\n- It reinforces the abuser's narrative\n\n### Why These Messages Are Harmful\n\nYou already know that language matters when working with survivors. These messages:\n- Place responsibility for stopping abuse on the survivor instead of the person causing harm\n- Create shame and isolation\n- Demonstrate a lack of understanding about IPV dynamics\n- Can cause survivors to stop seeking help"

          "content": "## Why Do Some Survivors Stay?\n\nOne of the questions survivors of intimate partner violence get asked the most is \"Why do you stay?\" People often wonder why survivors would stay with a partner who is abusing them.\n\n**The Right Question:**\n\nIntimate partner violence is never a survivor's fault. By asking survivors why they choose to stay, we are putting the responsibility on them to stop the violence they are experiencing. Instead, we should be asking people who cause harm why they choose to abuse so that we are putting the responsibility on them to stop their violence.\n\n### The Danger of Leaving\n\n**We often focus on how dangerous being in an abusive relationship is for a survivor but forget to think about how dangerous leaving can actually be.**\n\nLeaving is the most dangerous time for survivors because:\n- Leaving threatens the person's control over them\n- The person causing harm may use violence to reestablish that control\n- That violence can be deadly\n- Studies show that women are much more likely to be killed by their abusive partner **after separating** from them than at any other point in the relationship\n\n### There Are Many Reasons a Survivor May Stay\n\n**Safety Concerns:**\n- Fear of escalated violence or death\n- Threats to harm children or other family members\n- Threats to harm pets\n- Fear of losing custody of children\n\n**Practical Barriers:**\n- Lack of financial resources\n- No safe place to go\n- Lack of job or employment sabotage\n- Immigration status concerns\n- Lack of accessible shelters (especially for people with disabilities)\n\n**Emotional and Psychological Factors:**\n- Love for the partner and hope they will change\n- Belief that keeping the family together is best for children\n- Trauma bonding and psychological manipulation\n- Low self-esteem from ongoing abuse\n- Cultural or religious beliefs about marriage and family\n\n**Social and Institutional Barriers:**\n- Isolation from friends and family\n- Lack of community support\n- Previous negative experiences with law enforcement or courts\n- Fear of not being believed\n- Cultural stigma about divorce or leaving\n\n### Understanding Individual Circumstances\n\nAs you can see, survivors stay with abusive partners for many personal reasons. Each circumstance is different, and the reason one survivor stays may be different than someone else.\n\nFor some, threats to family or children can create a sense of responsibility that keeps women in abusive relationships. For others, lack of resources, finances, or support make it difficult to leave.\n\n**Often a survivor's decision to stay is an informed one, made with their safety in mind.**\n\nUnderstanding how individual circumstances and variables interact with a survivor's ability to leave an abusive relationship is necessary to develop a proper safety plan with a survivor or a family."

Safety planning should be collaborative, not directive."

In Davies' Victim-Defined Safety Planning Summary, she states that **\"The spiritual, social, and emotional aspects of our humanity are also necessary for security.\"**\n\n### Three Elements Survivors Consider When Assessing Safety Strategies:\n\n1. **No violence** - Freedom from physical and sexual assault\n2. **Basic human needs** - Food, shelter, financial security\n3. **Social and emotional well-being** - Connection, self-esteem, autonomy\n\n### Life-Generated Risks\n\nIn addition to the risks associated with their abusive partner, a survivor must also consider their **life-generated risks**—risks in their life that they may have no control over such as:\n\n- Health issues\n- Financial concerns\n- Social supports\n- Immigration status\n- Custody concerns\n- Employment stability\n\n## Reevaluating \"Safety\"\n\nWhen deciding if a survivor is \"safe,\" we often look at whether or not they are free from the abuse of their partner. It is important to remember, however, that a survivor's safety also includes their social and emotional needs.\n\n### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs\n\nIn 1943, psychologist Abraham Maslow outlined what is now called **Maslow's hierarchy of needs**, which identifies the five \"needs\" that drive human behavior:\n\n1. **Physiological** (bottom) - Food, water, sleep, shelter\n2. **Safety** - Security, employment, health\n3. **Belonging** - Friendship, family, intimacy\n4. **Esteem** - Respect, recognition, confidence\n5. **Self-actualization** (top) - Achieving full potential\n\nMaslow argues that to get to the top of the pyramid (self-fulfillment), you first need to satisfy everything below it.\n\n### Safety Beyond Physical Security\n\nWhen we talk about safety and survivors of intimate partner violence, it's easy for us to think once a survivor reaches the second level of this pyramid, then they are safe and no longer require help. But for a survivor to truly find safety, they must be more than just physically safe.\n\n**According to Dr. Jacqueline Campbell:**\n\n\"A survivor who is no longer hit by their partner but cannot feed her children or pay her bills **isn't safe**, nor is she safe if she is still suffering from the effects of trauma.\"\n\n### True Safety Means:\n\n- **No violence** - Physical and sexual safety\n- **Basic needs are met** - Food, shelter, financial security\n- **Social and emotional well-being** - Connection, healing, self-esteem\n\nWe also want survivors to achieve emotional safety, make social connections, and recognize their strengths.\n\nIf the foundation of abuse is that a survivor has had their power and control taken away, then to resolve that, we must help the person regain that control in their life."

Remember that there isn't one \"correct\" way to handle every situation.\n\n### General Tips for Responding:\n\n- **Be open to talking about relationships and having uncomfortable conversations** - Creating space for disclosure is the first step\n\n- **The most important thing you can do is be supportive and listen non-judgmentally** - Your role is to support, not to judge or fix\n\n- **Recognize that it's okay if you don't have all the answers** - You are not expected to be an expert; connecting to resources is part of support\n\n- **It is not your role to rescue people** - Honoring autonomy means supporting their decisions, not making decisions for them\n\n- **Know where you can refer survivors** - Have resources ready and encourage them to talk to people who can provide specialized help and guidance\n\n### Helpful Messages to Share\n\nYou already know that language matters when working with survivors. When responding, try using helpful statements that remind a survivor that the abuse is not their fault and they are not alone.\n\n**Examples of Helpful Messages:**\n\n- **\"I believe you\"** - Validates their experience and builds trust\n\n- **\"This is not your fault\"** - Counters self-blame and reinforces that responsibility belongs with the person causing harm\n\n- **\"You don't deserve to be treated this way\"** - Affirms their worth and dignity\n\n- **\"I'm worried about your safety\"** - Expresses care without judgment\n\n- **\"You are not alone\"** - Reduces isolation and offers connection\n\n- **\"I'm here for you\"** - Provides ongoing support without pressure\n\n- **\"What do you need right now?\"** - Centers their autonomy and current needs\n\n- **\"This must be really difficult\"** - Acknowledges the complexity of their situation"

People who cause harm learn these behaviors through our culture, communities, schools, family, personal experience, and peer groups.\n\nThe **community-accountability model of male violence against women** illustrates the different systems that can support or discourage violence against women. It shows that **community-based solutions are needed to address intimate partner violence**.\n\n### The Men Stopping Violence Community-Accountability Model\n\nThis model depicts **five levels of community influence:**\n\n**1. The Individual**\n- The individual person, their actions, and all the forces that influence their behavior\n\n**2. The Primary Community**\n- The group closest to the individual\n- Can consist of family, school friends, clubs, gangs, or any group that functions in a family-like role\n- The communities the individual engages with most frequently\n\n**3. The Micro-Community**\n- Tied to the primary community but on a larger scale\n- Can include religious communities, the broader school system, civic groups, social service agencies\n\n**4. The Macro-Community**\n- Yet one additional layer away from the individual\n- Can include very large group numbers scattered across the country\n- The individual may never directly engage with it but is subject to its rules, values, and guidelines\n- Examples: organized religion, governments, mass media, high-level courts, large corporations\n\n**5. The Global Community**\n- Encapsulates all other communities\n- Has influence on all those that fall under it\n- Examples: patriarchy, colonialism\n- More abstract but significant impact on individual development\n\n### How the Model Works\n\nThe five levels of community are depicted as nested ovals. The arrows illustrate how each level influences and interacts with the others—going **both directions** from the individual to progressively larger communities, and from the global community back to the individual.\n\n**This demonstrates:**\n\n- This ecosystem works together\n- Any changes to one level, or the messages reinforced in each level, will naturally impact the others\n- Impacting messaging at ANY level can work to prevent intimate partner violence by disrupting existing reinforced messaging\n- By changing the mindset, behaviors, and beliefs of individuals and even primary and micro-communities, those changes ripple throughout the ecosystem"

It looks at the contributions society makes to individual development and the way it influences their treatment of others.\n\n**Learning about violence against women and its historical and cultural context invites individuals to shift the way they view the world and their place in it.**\n\nPeople are taught that the use of coercion, dominance, and control in relationships with women reflects their internalization of social norms communicated through their day-to-day interactions within primary communities, micro-communities, and macro-communities. They are challenged to accept responsibility for making choices that prevent destructive behaviors.\n\n### The Role of Media and Culture\n\nThe role mainstream media plays in the reinforcement of historical and cultural contexts is a clear example. The way TV shows, movies, and news outlets discuss and portray violence against women can have an impact on how individuals view the issue.\n\nThe media can also influence our ideas on how men and women should act, or \"gendered stereotypes,\" instead of valuing people as whole human beings.\n\n**By examining the many ways society reinforces sexism and the use of violence against women, we can identify actions that might be taken on personal, cultural, and institutional levels to end the tolerance of abuse. As a community, we can nurture a society where violence against women is unacceptable.**\n\n## Know Your Resources\n\nIt is crucial to have resources ready when survivors disclose to you. Being prepared helps you provide immediate, practical support.\n\n### National Resources:\n\n**National Domestic Violence Hotline**\n- Available 24/7\n- Phone: 1-800-799-7233\n- TTY: 1-800-787-3224\n- Online chat available\n- Provides crisis intervention, safety planning, and referrals to local resources\n\n**National Sexual Assault Hotline**\n- Available 24/7\n- Phone: 1-800-656-HOPE (4673)\n- Online chat available through RAINN\n\n### Local Resources:\n\nYou can also contact your statewide domestic violence coalition to find resources in your area and locate your local domestic violence center. If you don't know your statewide coalition, the National Domestic Violence Hotline lists them on their website.\n\nMany of these programs have a 24-hour hotline available with advocates who specialize in intimate partner violence.\n\n### Resources Are for Everyone\n\nIt is important to remember that these resources are not only for survivors of intimate partner violence, but also for friends, families, and community members. Watching someone experience abuse is challenging, especially if that person is someone you know and love, so **don't forget to take care of yourself as well**.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUltimately, understanding how to recognize intimate partner violence and intimate partner sexual violence will prepare you to support individuals who choose to disclose their circumstances to you.\n\nBy understanding:\n- The types of abuse\n- How power and control are used to perpetuate abuse\n- How intimate partner violence intersects with sexual violence\n- Why survivors stay and how to support their safety\n- How to respond with trauma-informed care\n- How community accountability creates systemic change\n\n**You can be a better ally and resource for survivors who reach out to you.**\n\nSuccessfully completing this course does not make you an intimate partner violence service expert, but it prepares you to have informed, supportive, and educated interactions with survivors you may encounter.\n\n**To be a successful ally:**\n- Collect resources and information that you can share\n- Challenge harmful attitudes in your communities\n- Support survivor autonomy and decision-making\n- Continue learning and growing in your understanding\n\n**We each have a role to play in ending intimate partner violence and by working together, we hope to achieve that goal.**"
