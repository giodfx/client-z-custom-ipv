For this course, we will use the House of Ruth Maryland standard definition, which focuses on the experience of the survivor and addresses the survivor's need for support and services.\n\n**Two Critical Elements:**\n\nThe two most important elements to remember about the definition of intimate partner violence are:\n\n1. **It is a pattern of behaviors** - not isolated incidents\n2. **There is a power imbalance** between the intimate partners—one partner holds some power over the other\n\n### IPV vs. Domestic Violence\n\nMore commonly, you will hear the term \"domestic violence\" used when talking about intimate partner violence, but it is important to remember that **not all partners live together** and **not all violence in a home is between partners**.\n\nThe term \"intimate partner\" refers to any intimate relationship between people:\n- Long-term or short-term\n- Formal or casual\n- Public or private\n- Serious or not\n\n### Who Is Affected\n\nIntimate partner violence can happen to **anyone** regardless of:\n- Race\n- Age  \n- Sexual orientation\n- Religion\n- Ability\n- Gender\n\n### Forms of IPV\n\nIt can take many forms, including:\n- Physical abuse\n- Sexual abuse\n- Emotional abuse\n- Economic abuse\n- Psychological abuse\n\n### Broader Impact\n\nIPV impacts individuals, families, workplaces, and communities. Since intimate partner violence is framed within the global issue of violence against women, it is shaped and supported by societal, familial, and cultural norms and is complicated by the intersection of other cultural oppressions."

This course provides you with the foundational knowledge needed to recognize intimate partner violence and how to respond to survivors of it.\n\n**By the end of this course, you will be able to:**\n\n- **Identify** essential elements of intimate partner violence\n- **Identify** how sexual assault connects to intimate partner violence  \n- **Recognize** ways society impacts our views on violence against women\n- **Determine** appropriate responses to survivors of intimate partner violence\n\nAs you progress through this training, think of yourself as **Maria**, a coordinated entry worker conducting intake assessments; or **Dr. Patel**, a healthcare provider integrating IPV screening; or **Aisha**, an HR professional recognizing workplace warning signs; or **James**, an IPV advocate providing trauma-informed support. Each of these professionals encounters IPV in their work—and now, you will too."
