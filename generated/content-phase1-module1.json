Understanding the scope of this issue is essential for recognizing its impact across communities.\n\n**According to the CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey:**\n\n- About **1 in 4 women** and nearly **1 in 10 men** have experienced contact sexual violence, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime and reported some form of IPV-related impact\n\n- Data from U.S. crime reports suggest that **16% (about 1 in 6)** of homicide victims are killed by an intimate partner\n\n- About **11 million women** and **5 million men** who reported experiencing contact sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime said that they **first experienced these forms of violence before the age of 18**\n\nThese statistics reveal that IPV is a widespread public health issue affecting millions of individuals. The data also shows that IPV often begins early in life, highlighting the importance of prevention and early intervention."

There are harmful stereotypes that survivors are:\n\n- Poor, uneducated, and totally reliant on the person causing harm\n- Meek and don't stand up for themselves\n- Have low self-esteem\n- Disheveled, nervous, and jumpy\n- Put up with or excuse abusive behavior\n- Have traditional beliefs about gender roles\n\n**Why These Stereotypes Are Harmful:**\n\nMaking these generalizations reinforces the idea that only certain types of people are affected by intimate partner violence. It is important to emphasize, however, that **intimate partner violence occurs in every demographic regardless of age, race, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic class**.\n\nAssuming that intimate partner violence only happens in certain communities can make it easy to overlook signs and symptoms that someone we know is experiencing abuse in their relationship.\n\n**The Reality:**\n\nIPV can happen to anyone:\n- Across all income levels\n- In all racial and ethnic communities\n- Regardless of education level\n- In all types of relationships\n- Regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation\n- In all religious and cultural backgrounds\n\nAs professionals like Dr. Patel conducting health screenings or Aisha monitoring workplace dynamics, recognizing that IPV crosses all boundaries is essential for trauma-informed practice."

Review each type of violence and its examples below.\n\n### Physical Abuse\nPhysical violence includes any intentional use of physical force with the potential to cause harm, including:\n- Hitting, slapping, punching, kicking\n- Choking or strangling\n- Burning\n- Using weapons\n- Physical restraint\n\n### Sexual Abuse\nSexual violence includes any sexual act or attempt without consent, including:\n- Forced sexual contact\n- Sexual coercion\n- Reproductive control\n- Refusing to use protection\n\n### Emotional/Psychological Abuse\nPsychological abuse involves verbal and non-verbal behaviors that harm someone's mental health, including:\n- Name-calling and insults\n- Humiliation and degradation\n- Threats and intimidation\n- Isolation from friends and family\n- Gaslighting (making someone question their reality)\n\n### Economic Abuse\nEconomic violence involves controlling access to financial resources, including:\n- Preventing someone from working\n- Controlling all finances\n- Withholding money for necessities\n- Sabotaging employment\n- Running up debt in someone's name"

Pico-Alfonso et al. found that \"while some subjects experienced only psychological abuse, all those who experienced physical abuse were also subjected to some form of psychological abuse.\"\n\n**What This Means:**\n\n- Psychological abuse often comes first and creates the foundation for other forms of abuse\n- Physical violence rarely happens in isolation—it's typically part of a larger pattern of control\n- Multiple forms of abuse working together create a more powerful system of control\n- Understanding this overlap helps professionals like Dr. Patel recognize early warning signs before physical violence occurs"

One of the most common and powerful tools to aid survivors, service providers, and people who cause harm in describing and recognizing patterns of abuse is called the **Power and Control Wheel**.\n\n### Origins of the Wheel\n\nIn the early 1980s, Ellen Pence and her colleagues at the Domestic Abuse Intervention Project (DAIP) in Duluth, MN created the Power and Control Wheel. To create the model, Pence and the DAIP team interviewed survivors of intimate partner violence to identify their common experiences.\n\nPence and the Duluth team took great pains to document the most common abusive behaviors, or \"tactics,\" that were used against the women they interviewed. The wheel they created includes the tactics that were most universally experienced.\n\n**Important to Remember:**\n\nAs with all models, it is important to remember that not all survivors experience abuse in the same way, but that does not invalidate anyone's experience or mean that what they experienced is not abuse."

When tactics on the inside of the wheel stop working, then the abuse may escalate to physical and sexual assault. The outer ring works as both a threat of escalation and as the end result of the escalation itself."

With this in mind, the Duluth Abuse Intervention Project created an **Equality Wheel** to accompany the Power and Control Wheel. The Equality Wheel shows the healthy behaviors that partners should use in their relationships instead of the controlling behaviors shown in the Power and Control Wheel.\n\n**Comparing the Wheels:**\n\nNotice how the healthy behaviors inside the Equality Wheel are reinforced by the non-violence on the outside of the wheel. Using the Equality Wheel to speak with survivors about intimate partner violence can help them see their experience in a different way—especially for individuals who are resistant to calling their experience abuse.\n\nBy seeing the healthy behaviors and actions next to the unhealthy ones in the Power and Control Wheel, survivors may have a breakthrough they may not have had otherwise when presented with the dichotomy of behaviors."

There are many studies that support each of these claims, but researcher Michael P. Johnson found that the discrepancies in these studies mainly came from the **different definitions being used for intimate partner violence**.\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nSome researchers were using intimate partner violence to describe a relationship where one partner had coercive control over the other partner, while other researchers described intimate partner violence as a partner using an abusive behavior at any point in their relationship.\n\n### Johnson's Typology\n\nIn 2008, Michael P. Johnson introduced what he called \"A Typology of Domestic Violence.\" This typology is widely used to categorize different types of intimate partner violence to better provide resources and support to survivors.\n\n**According to Johnson, there are three main types of Intimate Partner Violence:**\n\n1. **Intimate Terrorism** - A pattern of violence combined with a broader pattern of control; one partner uses violence and other controlling tactics to dominate the other\n\n2. **Situational Couple Violence** - Violence that arises in the context of specific arguments or conflicts but is not part of a general pattern of control\n\n3. **Violent Resistance** - Violence used by someone experiencing intimate terrorism in an attempt to resist or defend against their partner's violence and control\n\n**Note:** A fourth type has been identified (\"Mutual Violent Resistance\") but has not yet been fully researched. For our purposes, and for work in the field, we focus on the original three types that Johnson defined in his work."

A single incident doesn't tell the full story—you need to understand the broader pattern.\n\n### Gender and Violence\n\nAny individual can choose to abuse their partner. Still, women's violence in a relationship usually takes the form of responsive violence. In contrast, only a small group of women use violence in their relationships to gain coercive control over their partner.\n\n**Social Context:**\n\nSocial norms and institutions also make it more difficult for women to exert coercive control over a male partner. Understanding these dynamics helps us provide appropriate, trauma-informed support."

Accuracy in terminology matters to each of these groups and can have long-lasting ramifications.

Consider these questions:\n\n**Types of Abuse:**\n- What types of abuse can you identify in this case?\n- How do different forms of abuse overlap and reinforce each other?\n- Which behaviors fit into physical, emotional, economic, or sexual abuse categories?\n\n**Power and Control:**\n- How does James Sumpter create and use a power imbalance?\n- Which sections of the Power and Control Wheel do you see represented?\n- How do the tactics on the inside of the wheel relate to the violence on the outside?\n\n**The Pattern:**\n- Is this intimate terrorism, situational couple violence, or violent resistance?\n- What evidence helps you make this determination?\n- How does the timeline reveal escalation or patterns of control?\n\n### What the Case Illustrates\n\nThis case exemplifies how the Power and Control Wheel can be used to illustrate to survivors how what they experience contributes to an environment in which a person who causes harm creates and uses a power imbalance to gain control in the relationship.\n\nFor professionals like James providing IPV advocacy or Maria conducting intake assessments, being able to recognize these patterns is essential for trauma-informed support."
