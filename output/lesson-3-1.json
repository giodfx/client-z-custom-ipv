But as we descend to this depth, we discover the question itself is wrong. The real question is: why do people choose to abuse? Understanding this shift is the foundation of trauma-informed response.",

        "content": "## Responding to Intimate Partner Violence\n\nWhen a friend, family member, or coworker chooses to disclose to you that they are experiencing intimate partner violence or intimate partner sexual violence, it is easy to feel overwhelmed, nervous, or scared. It's normal to want to help someone who has entrusted you with their experience, but it is important to know how to respond in ways that will be supportive to the survivor.\n\n**By the end of this module you will be able to:**\n\n- Identify reasons why leaving an abusive relationship can be difficult for survivors\n- Recognize messages that are harmful to survivors of intimate partner violence\n- Determine ways to respond to someone experiencing intimate partner violence\n\n### The Importance of Listening\n\nListening to survivors is critical in understanding the problem that people experiencing intimate partner violence face. Survivors like Rebel explain the challenges they faced and the ripple effect that victimization can have on family members and the community at large.\n\nPay particular attention to how survivors talk about the abuse they experienced and their difficulty recognizing it as intimate partner violence. As you can see from survivor accounts, abuse does not fit neatly into a single box, which can make it hard for people to identify the abuse happening to them.\n\n**There is no one who understands the impact of intimate partner violence more than a survivor who has experienced it, but it can be helpful for them to know that they are not alone in this experience and the abuse is not their fault.**"

        "title": "Messages That Harm",
        "content": "## Messages That Are NOT Helpful, but Survivors Often Hear\n\nIf you have ever encountered a survivor of intimate partner violence, you will have probably heard horror stories about the ways individuals have tried to \"help\" them or \"give advice.\" Friends, colleagues, relatives, community members, and even people causing harm themselves have been known to offer what they thought was helpful information, but was actually harmful information, to individuals in an abusive relationship.\n\n### Common Harmful Messages:\n\n**\"Why don't you just leave?\"**\n- This places responsibility on the survivor to stop the violence\n- It ignores the many barriers to leaving\n- It fails to acknowledge that leaving is the most dangerous time\n\n**\"It can't be that bad if you're still there\"**\n- This minimizes the survivor's experience\n- It doesn't recognize the complex dynamics of abuse\n- It suggests the survivor is exaggerating\n\n**\"You just need to stand up for yourself\"**\n- This ignores the power imbalance that defines IPV\n- It suggests the abuse is the survivor's fault for not being strong enough\n- It doesn't recognize that resistance can increase danger\n\n**\"I would never put up with that\"**\n- This is judgmental and creates shame\n- It suggests the survivor is weak or making bad choices\n- It fails to recognize that anyone can experience IPV\n\n**\"What did you do to make them so angry?\"**\n- This directly blames the survivor for the abuse\n- It suggests abuse is a justified response to behavior\n- It reinforces the abuser's narrative\n\n### Why These Messages Are Harmful\n\nYou already know that language matters when working with survivors. These messages:\n- Place responsibility for stopping abuse on the survivor instead of the person causing harm\n- Create shame and isolation\n- Demonstrate a lack of understanding about IPV dynamics\n- Can cause survivors to stop seeking help"

        "title": "Why Survivors Stay",
        "content": "## Why Do Some Survivors Stay?\n\nOne of the questions survivors of intimate partner violence get asked the most is \"Why do you stay?\" People often wonder why survivors would stay with a partner who is abusing them.\n\n**The Right Question:**\n\nIntimate partner violence is never a survivor's fault. By asking survivors why they choose to stay, we are putting the responsibility on them to stop the violence they are experiencing. Instead, we should be asking people who cause harm why they choose to abuse so that we are putting the responsibility on them to stop their violence.\n\n### The Danger of Leaving\n\n**We often focus on how dangerous being in an abusive relationship is for a survivor but forget to think about how dangerous leaving can actually be.**\n\nLeaving is the most dangerous time for survivors because:\n- Leaving threatens the person's control over them\n- The person causing harm may use violence to reestablish that control\n- That violence can be deadly\n- Studies show that women are much more likely to be killed by their abusive partner **after separating** from them than at any other point in the relationship\n\n### There Are Many Reasons a Survivor May Stay\n\n**Safety Concerns:**\n- Fear of escalated violence or death\n- Threats to harm children or other family members\n- Threats to harm pets\n- Fear of losing custody of children\n\n**Practical Barriers:**\n- Lack of financial resources\n- No safe place to go\n- Lack of job or employment sabotage\n- Immigration status concerns\n- Lack of accessible shelters (especially for people with disabilities)\n\n**Emotional and Psychological Factors:**\n- Love for the partner and hope they will change\n- Belief that keeping the family together is best for children\n- Trauma bonding and psychological manipulation\n- Low self-esteem from ongoing abuse\n- Cultural or religious beliefs about marriage and family\n\n**Social and Institutional Barriers:**\n- Isolation from friends and family\n- Lack of community support\n- Previous negative experiences with law enforcement or courts\n- Fear of not being believed\n- Cultural stigma about divorce or leaving\n\n### Understanding Individual Circumstances\n\nAs you can see, survivors stay with abusive partners for many personal reasons. Each circumstance is different, and the reason one survivor stays may be different than someone else.\n\nFor some, threats to family or children can create a sense of responsibility that keeps women in abusive relationships. For others, lack of resources, finances, or support make it difficult to leave.\n\n**Often a survivor's decision to stay is an informed one, made with their safety in mind.**\n\nUnderstanding how individual circumstances and variables interact with a survivor's ability to leave an abusive relationship is necessary to develop a proper safety plan with a survivor or a family."

      "The question 'Why do survivors stay?' places blame on the wrong person—we should ask 'Why do people choose to abuse?'",
      "Leaving is the most dangerous time for survivors; women are more likely to be killed after separating than during the relationship",
      "Survivors face multiple barriers to leaving including safety concerns, practical obstacles, emotional factors, and social/institutional barriers",
      "Harmful messages like 'just leave' or 'it can't be that bad' create shame, place blame on survivors, and can cause them to stop seeking help",
      "Often a survivor's decision to stay is an informed one made with their safety in mind",

        "explanation": "Instead of asking 'Why do survivors stay?', we should be asking 'WHY DO PEOPLE CHOOSE TO ABUSE?' By asking survivors why they stay, we put the responsibility on THEM to stop the violence they're experiencing. The responsibility belongs with the person causing harm. This shift in perspective is essential for trauma-informed practice and ensures we don't blame survivors for the abuse they experience."

        "prompt": "According to the research, when are survivors at the HIGHEST risk of being killed by their abusive partner?",
        "options": [
          "During the honeymoon phase of the cycle of violence",

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Survivors are at HIGHEST risk AFTER SEPARATING from the abusive partner. Studies show that women are much more likely to be killed by their abusive partner after leaving than at any other point in the relationship. Leaving threatens the abuser's control, and they may use violence—including lethal violence—to reestablish that control. This is why 'just leave' is not only unhelpful advice but potentially dangerous."

          "It has no impact on survivors"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "The statement 'I would never put up with that' is JUDGMENTAL and CREATES SHAME. It suggests the survivor is weak or making bad choices, and fails to recognize that ANYONE can experience IPV regardless of strength or character. This type of statement can cause survivors to feel isolated, ashamed, and less likely to seek help. Remember: IPV can happen to anyone, and staying is often a complex decision influenced by multiple barriers."
