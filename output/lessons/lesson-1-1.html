Understanding the scope of this issue is essential for recognizing its impact across communities.</p><p><strong>According to the CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey:</strong></p><p>- About <strong>1 in 4 women</strong> and nearly <strong>1 in 10 men</strong> have experienced contact sexual violence, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime and reported some form of IPV-related impact</p><p>- Data from U.S. crime reports suggest that <strong>16% (about 1 in 6)</strong> of homicide victims are killed by an intimate partner</p><p>- About <strong>11 million women</strong> and <strong>5 million men</strong> who reported experiencing contact sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime said that they <strong>first experienced these forms of violence before the age of 18</strong></p><p>These statistics reveal that IPV is a widespread public health issue affecting millions of individuals. The data also shows that IPV often begins early in life, highlighting the importance of prevention and early intervention.</p><h2>Breaking Down Stereotypes</h2><h3>Myths About Survivors</h3><p>Sometimes people have a very specific image in their mind of what a survivor of intimate partner violence looks like. There are harmful stereotypes that survivors are:</p><ul><li><p>Poor, uneducated, and totally reliant on the person causing harm</p></li><li><p>Meek and don't stand up for themselves</p></li><li><p>Have low self-esteem</p></li><li><p>Disheveled, nervous, and jumpy</p></li><li><p>Put up with or excuse abusive behavior</p></li><li><p>Have traditional beliefs about gender roles</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why These Stereotypes Are Harmful:</strong></p><p>Making these generalizations reinforces the idea that only certain types of people are affected by intimate partner violence. It is important to emphasize, however, that <strong>intimate partner violence occurs in every demographic regardless of age, race, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic class</strong>.</p><p>Assuming that intimate partner violence only happens in certain communities can make it easy to overlook signs and symptoms that someone we know is experiencing abuse in their relationship.</p><p><strong>The Reality:</strong></p><p>IPV can happen to anyone:</p><ul><li><p>Across all income levels</p></li><li><p>In all racial and ethnic communities</p></li><li><p>Regardless of education level</p></li><li><p>In all types of relationships</p></li><li><p>Regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation</p></li><li><p>In all religious and cultural backgrounds</p></li></ul><p>As professionals like Dr. Patel conducting health screenings or Aisha monitoring workplace dynamics, recognizing that IPV crosses all boundaries is essential for trauma-informed practice.</p><h3>🎯 Interactive Activity: Abuse Type Categorization</h3><p>Drag each behavior into the correct abuse category.</p><p>Behaviors to Categorize:</p><p> Pushing, shoving, or hitting</p><p> Constant criticism and humiliation</p><p> Controlling access to money</p><p> Forcing unwanted sexual acts</p><p> Preventing contact with family/friends</p><p><strong>Physical Abuse</strong></p><p><strong>Emotional Abuse</strong></p><p><strong>Economic Abuse</strong></p><p><strong>Sexual Abuse</strong></p><p><strong>Isolation/Control</strong></p><p><strong> Check Answers</strong></p><h2>Quiz</h2><p>Question 1 of 3</p><h3>IPV Prevalence</h3><p>According to the CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, approximately how many women experience contact sexual violence, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime?</p><p>About 1 in 10 women About 1 in 4 women About 1 in 2 women About 1 in 20 women</p><h3>Universal Impact</h3><p>Which statement is TRUE about who can experience intimate partner violence?</p><p>IPV primarily affects people from low-income communities IPV occurs in every demographic regardless of age, race, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic class IPV mostly affects people with low self-esteem who don't stand up for themselves IPV is most common among people who have traditional beliefs about gender roles</p><h3>Early Onset</h3><p>What does the data tell us about when many people first experience intimate partner violence?</p><p>Most people first experience IPV in their 30s and 40s IPV typically begins after marriage Many people first experience IPV before the age of 18 IPV usually begins in retirement years</p><p><strong>Previous</strong> <strong>Next Question</strong> <strong>Submit Quiz</strong></p><h2>Quiz Complete!</h2><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Review Answers</strong></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="text-blue-600 underline lesson-nav-button lesson-nav-prev" href="lesson-intro-1.html">Previous Lesson Introduction: What is Intimate Partner Violence?</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="text-blue-600 underline lesson-nav-button lesson-nav-next" href="lesson-1-2.html">Next Lesson Types of Abuse</a></p>
