        "content": "## How Common is Intimate Partner Violence?\n\nIntimate partner violence is far more common than many people realize. Understanding the scope of this issue is essential for recognizing its impact across communities.\n\n**According to the CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey:**\n\n- About **1 in 4 women** and nearly **1 in 10 men** have experienced contact sexual violence, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime and reported some form of IPV-related impact\n\n- Data from U.S. crime reports suggest that **16% (about 1 in 6)** of homicide victims are killed by an intimate partner\n\n- About **11 million women** and **5 million men** who reported experiencing contact sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime said that they **first experienced these forms of violence before the age of 18**\n\nThese statistics reveal that IPV is a widespread public health issue affecting millions of individuals. The data also shows that IPV often begins early in life, highlighting the importance of prevention and early intervention."

        "content": "## Myths About Survivors\n\nSometimes people have a very specific image in their mind of what a survivor of intimate partner violence looks like. There are harmful stereotypes that survivors are:\n\n- Poor, uneducated, and totally reliant on the person causing harm\n- Meek and don't stand up for themselves\n- Have low self-esteem\n- Disheveled, nervous, and jumpy\n- Put up with or excuse abusive behavior\n- Have traditional beliefs about gender roles\n\n**Why These Stereotypes Are Harmful:**\n\nMaking these generalizations reinforces the idea that only certain types of people are affected by intimate partner violence. It is important to emphasize, however, that **intimate partner violence occurs in every demographic regardless of age, race, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic class**.\n\nAssuming that intimate partner violence only happens in certain communities can make it easy to overlook signs and symptoms that someone we know is experiencing abuse in their relationship.\n\n**The Reality:**\n\nIPV can happen to anyone:\n- Across all income levels\n- In all racial and ethnic communities\n- Regardless of education level\n- In all types of relationships\n- Regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation\n- In all religious and cultural backgrounds\n\nAs professionals like Dr. Patel conducting health screenings or Aisha monitoring workplace dynamics, recognizing that IPV crosses all boundaries is essential for trauma-informed practice."
