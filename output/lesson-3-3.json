        "content": "## Responding to Someone Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence\n\nResponding to someone who is experiencing intimate partner violence can seem overwhelming, and it's normal to want to get it right when helping others. Remember that there isn't one \"correct\" way to handle every situation.\n\n### General Tips for Responding:\n\n- **Be open to talking about relationships and having uncomfortable conversations** - Creating space for disclosure is the first step\n\n- **The most important thing you can do is be supportive and listen non-judgmentally** - Your role is to support, not to judge or fix\n\n- **Recognize that it's okay if you don't have all the answers** - You are not expected to be an expert; connecting to resources is part of support\n\n- **It is not your role to rescue people** - Honoring autonomy means supporting their decisions, not making decisions for them\n\n- **Know where you can refer survivors** - Have resources ready and encourage them to talk to people who can provide specialized help and guidance\n\n### Helpful Messages to Share\n\nYou already know that language matters when working with survivors. When responding, try using helpful statements that remind a survivor that the abuse is not their fault and they are not alone.\n\n**Examples of Helpful Messages:**\n\n- **\"I believe you\"** - Validates their experience and builds trust\n\n- **\"This is not your fault\"** - Counters self-blame and reinforces that responsibility belongs with the person causing harm\n\n- **\"You don't deserve to be treated this way\"** - Affirms their worth and dignity\n\n- **\"I'm worried about your safety\"** - Expresses care without judgment\n\n- **\"You are not alone\"** - Reduces isolation and offers connection\n\n- **\"I'm here for you\"** - Provides ongoing support without pressure\n\n- **\"What do you need right now?\"** - Centers their autonomy and current needs\n\n- **\"This must be really difficult\"** - Acknowledges the complexity of their situation"

        "title": "Community Accountability Model",
        "content": "## Responding as a Community\n\nIntimate partner violence is a socially supported behavior, learned through observation, experience, and reinforcement. People who cause harm learn these behaviors through our culture, communities, schools, family, personal experience, and peer groups.\n\nThe **community-accountability model of male violence against women** illustrates the different systems that can support or discourage violence against women. It shows that **community-based solutions are needed to address intimate partner violence**.\n\n### The Men Stopping Violence Community-Accountability Model\n\nThis model depicts **five levels of community influence:**\n\n**1. The Individual**\n- The individual person, their actions, and all the forces that influence their behavior\n\n**2. The Primary Community**\n- The group closest to the individual\n- Can consist of family, school friends, clubs, gangs, or any group that functions in a family-like role\n- The communities the individual engages with most frequently\n\n**3. The Micro-Community**\n- Tied to the primary community but on a larger scale\n- Can include religious communities, the broader school system, civic groups, social service agencies\n\n**4. The Macro-Community**\n- Yet one additional layer away from the individual\n- Can include very large group numbers scattered across the country\n- The individual may never directly engage with it but is subject to its rules, values, and guidelines\n- Examples: organized religion, governments, mass media, high-level courts, large corporations\n\n**5. The Global Community**\n- Encapsulates all other communities\n- Has influence on all those that fall under it\n- Examples: patriarchy, colonialism\n- More abstract but significant impact on individual development\n\n### How the Model Works\n\nThe five levels of community are depicted as nested ovals. The arrows illustrate how each level influences and interacts with the others—going **both directions** from the individual to progressively larger communities, and from the global community back to the individual.\n\n**This demonstrates:**\n\n- This ecosystem works together\n- Any changes to one level, or the messages reinforced in each level, will naturally impact the others\n- Impacting messaging at ANY level can work to prevent intimate partner violence by disrupting existing reinforced messaging\n- By changing the mindset, behaviors, and beliefs of individuals and even primary and micro-communities, those changes ripple throughout the ecosystem"

        "title": "Taking Action and Knowing Resources",
        "content": "## Challenging Unhealthy Assumptions\n\nThis model shows that individuals are shaped by what they see and experience in their community and our society at large. It looks at the contributions society makes to individual development and the way it influences their treatment of others.\n\n**Learning about violence against women and its historical and cultural context invites individuals to shift the way they view the world and their place in it.**\n\nPeople are taught that the use of coercion, dominance, and control in relationships with women reflects their internalization of social norms communicated through their day-to-day interactions within primary communities, micro-communities, and macro-communities. They are challenged to accept responsibility for making choices that prevent destructive behaviors.\n\n### The Role of Media and Culture\n\nThe role mainstream media plays in the reinforcement of historical and cultural contexts is a clear example. The way TV shows, movies, and news outlets discuss and portray violence against women can have an impact on how individuals view the issue.\n\nThe media can also influence our ideas on how men and women should act, or \"gendered stereotypes,\" instead of valuing people as whole human beings.\n\n**By examining the many ways society reinforces sexism and the use of violence against women, we can identify actions that might be taken on personal, cultural, and institutional levels to end the tolerance of abuse. As a community, we can nurture a society where violence against women is unacceptable.**\n\n## Know Your Resources\n\nIt is crucial to have resources ready when survivors disclose to you. Being prepared helps you provide immediate, practical support.\n\n### National Resources:\n\n**National Domestic Violence Hotline**\n- Available 24/7\n- Phone: 1-800-799-7233\n- TTY: 1-800-787-3224\n- Online chat available\n- Provides crisis intervention, safety planning, and referrals to local resources\n\n**National Sexual Assault Hotline**\n- Available 24/7\n- Phone: 1-800-656-HOPE (4673)\n- Online chat available through RAINN\n\n### Local Resources:\n\nYou can also contact your statewide domestic violence coalition to find resources in your area and locate your local domestic violence center. If you don't know your statewide coalition, the National Domestic Violence Hotline lists them on their website.\n\nMany of these programs have a 24-hour hotline available with advocates who specialize in intimate partner violence.\n\n### Resources Are for Everyone\n\nIt is important to remember that these resources are not only for survivors of intimate partner violence, but also for friends, families, and community members. Watching someone experience abuse is challenging, especially if that person is someone you know and love, so **don't forget to take care of yourself as well**.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUltimately, understanding how to recognize intimate partner violence and intimate partner sexual violence will prepare you to support individuals who choose to disclose their circumstances to you.\n\nBy understanding:\n- The types of abuse\n- How power and control are used to perpetuate abuse\n- How intimate partner violence intersects with sexual violence\n- Why survivors stay and how to support their safety\n- How to respond with trauma-informed care\n- How community accountability creates systemic change\n\n**You can be a better ally and resource for survivors who reach out to you.**\n\nSuccessfully completing this course does not make you an intimate partner violence service expert, but it prepares you to have informed, supportive, and educated interactions with survivors you may encounter.\n\n**To be a successful ally:**\n- Collect resources and information that you can share\n- Challenge harmful attitudes in your communities\n- Support survivor autonomy and decision-making\n- Continue learning and growing in your understanding\n\n**We each have a role to play in ending intimate partner violence and by working together, we hope to achieve that goal.**"

        "explanation": "Being PREPARED with resources helps you provide IMMEDIATE, PRACTICAL SUPPORT when someone trusts you with their disclosure. When a survivor discloses, they're taking a risk and showing trust in you. Having resources ready (like the National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233) allows you to offer concrete help while they're in a receptive state. This preparation demonstrates that you take IPV seriously and are ready to support them effectively."
