Welcome to this essential training on recognizing and responding to intimate partner violence. In the next few lessons, you'll gain critical knowledge to support those affected by IPV. Intimate partner violence includes physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. It encompasses economic control and represents a pattern of power and control rather than isolated incidents. IPV affects people across all demographics and communities. The statistics are sobering. Research shows that one in four women and one in seven men will experience severe intimate partner violence in their lifetime. This issue transcends age, race, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation. As professionals in healthcare, social services, or human resources, you're often the first point of contact for someone experiencing abuse. Your ability to recognize the signs can be life-changing. IPV manifests in many forms. Physical violence ranges from pushing to severe assault. Emotional abuse includes manipulation, threats, and isolation from support networks. Sexual violence involves any unwanted sexual contact. Economic abuse restricts financial independence and freedom. What distinguishes IPV from isolated conflicts is the pattern of power and control. One partner systematically dominates and controls the other through various tactics we'll explore in detail. The impact on survivors extends far beyond physical injuries. Victims often experience profound psychological trauma, PTSD, depression, and anxiety. They may face social isolation as abusers cut them off from family and friends. Economic abuse creates financial dependence that makes leaving extremely difficult. Your role isn't to solve the problem yourself. It's to recognize the signs, respond with trauma-informed care, provide resources, and empower survivors to make their own decisions about their safety. Throughout this course, we'll emphasize trauma-informed principles. This means prioritizing safety and trust, respecting survivor autonomy, collaborating rather than directing, and maintaining cultural sensitivity. Survivors are experts on their own situations. Critical resources exist to support survivors. The National Domestic Violence Hotline provides twenty-four-seven confidential support. Local advocacy organizations offer safety planning, legal assistance, and emergency shelter. In Module One, you'll learn to recognize IPV patterns using evidence-based frameworks. Module Two covers intimate partner sexual violence. Module Three teaches trauma-informed response strategies including safety planning. You're about to gain knowledge that can save lives. By completing this training, you'll be better equipped to recognize intimate partner violence and respond in ways that empower survivors. Let's begin.
