Safety planning is a collaborative process to help IPV victims reduce risk and prepare for emergencies. It's not about telling people to leave. It's about empowering them to make informed decisions and increase safety whether they stay or go. Safety planning creates a personalized strategy for each unique situation. It helps reduce risk of harm, prepares for dangerous situations or emergencies, and increases victims' sense of control and options. Effective safety plans are collaborative, practical, and survivor-driven. For those not yet ready or able to leave, safety planning focuses on risk reduction. This includes identifying safe rooms without weapons, planning escape routes, teaching children to call for help, establishing code words with trusted people, and hiding emergency supplies. Help victims recognize warning signs of escalation. Discuss avoiding rooms with weapons or without exits like kitchens, bathrooms, or bedrooms. Identify the safest exit routes from home. Practice what to say or do during incidents to reduce harm while abuse is occurring. Help victims prepare emergency supplies kept in a safe, accessible location. Include copies of important documents like IDs, birth certificates, and legal papers. Cash and credit cards. Extra keys. Medications. A change of clothes. Contact information for resources. These enable quick departure if needed. Leaving requires careful planning as this is the most dangerous time. Discuss timing, safe places to go, transportation, financial resources, and legal protections. Help identify obstacles and solutions. Emphasize that leaving doesn't have to be permanent to practice this planning. Help victims rebuild support networks abusers have destroyed. Identify trusted friends, family members, or neighbors who can offer help or call police. Establish workplace allies. Connect with IPV advocates and counselors. A support network increases safety and provides resources. Technology enables tracking and surveillance. Discuss changing passwords, using safe computers at libraries or work, disabling location services, checking for spyware, and using safety apps. Help victims understand their devices may be monitored and plan accordingly. Address financial barriers to leaving. Discuss opening separate bank accounts at different institutions. Building emergency funds slowly and secretly. Understanding shared finances and debts. Planning steps toward economic independence. Financial resources dramatically increase safety options. Inform victims about legal options including protection orders, custody provisions, and criminal charges. Explain the process, benefits, and limitations of each. Connect to legal advocates who can help navigate systems. Understanding options empowers informed decisions. Post-separation safety planning is critical as danger continues. Discuss changing routines, routes, and patterns. Alert security at residence and workplace. Document all contact and violations. Maintain protection orders. Prepare for potential stalking or continued harassment. Safety planning doesn't end at separation. Effective facilitation requires trauma-informed approaches. Ask open questions. Listen without judgment. Validate concerns. Respect their expertise about their situation. Never push your timeline. Provide information, not directives. Acknowledge that they're the expert on their life and relationship. Recognize your limitations. IPV advocates have specialized training and can provide comprehensive safety planning. Legal advocates help navigate complex systems. Mental health professionals address trauma. Know when to make warm referrals to specialists while maintaining your supportive role. Safety planning isn't about convincing people to leave. It's about increasing options, reducing risk, and supporting informed decision-making. By providing tools and resources, we empower survivors to make choices that are right for their unique situations and enhance their safety.
