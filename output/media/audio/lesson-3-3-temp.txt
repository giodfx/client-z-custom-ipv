How you respond when someone discloses intimate partner violence can profoundly impact their healing and safety. A supportive response validates their experience and opens pathways to help. A harmful response can cause additional trauma and prevent future disclosure. Trauma-informed care rests on five principles. Safety ensures physical and emotional security. Trustworthiness requires transparency and consistency. Choice respects autonomy. Collaboration involves shared decision-making. Empowerment builds on survivors' strengths. These principles should guide every interaction. Begin by ensuring immediate safety. Is the abuser present or nearby? Is it safe to talk now? Can they speak freely? Provide a private, comfortable space. Recognize that emotional safety matters too. Your calm, non-judgmental presence contributes to feeling safe. The most powerful response is simple belief. Say I believe you. Validate their feelings and experiences. Acknowledge the courage it took to disclose. Clearly state that the abuse is not their fault. Many survivors have never heard these messages before. Avoid common harmful responses. Never ask why they stayed or didn't leave sooner. Don't minimize their experience or compare to others. Don't tell them what to do or push your timeline. Avoid expressing shock or anger that might feel like judgment. Don't badmouth the abuser. Practice active listening without interrupting. Use open body language. Provide verbal acknowledgments like I hear you or that sounds really difficult. Reflect back what you're hearing. Allow silence when needed. Focus entirely on them, not on formulating your response. Respect that survivors are experts on their own situations and relationships. They understand risks and barriers you may not see. Honor their decisions even when you disagree. Provide information and options, but let them choose. Respecting autonomy counteracts the control they experience. Use respectful, empowering language. Say survivor or person experiencing abuse rather than victim when possible. Avoid dramatic language that sensationalizes. Use their preferred pronouns and terms. Be mindful of cultural context. Language shapes how people understand their experiences. When you suspect abuse, asking directly is appropriate. Use private settings. Ask open-ended questions like Are you safe at home? Has your partner hurt or threatened you? Frame questions non-judgmentally. If they're not ready to disclose, respect that and leave the door open for future conversations. Provide comprehensive resource information. The National Domestic Violence Hotline at one eight hundred seven nine nine seven two three three offers twenty-four seven support. Local IPV organizations provide advocacy. Legal aid assists with protection orders. Mental health services address trauma. Emergency shelters offer safety. Give resources even if not ready to use them now. Make warm referrals when possible. Don't just hand out numbers. Offer to call while they're with you. Introduce them to advocates. Explain what to expect. Follow up to ensure they connected. Warm referrals dramatically increase the likelihood people will access specialized services. Recognize what you can and can't do. You're not an IPV specialist, investigator, or therapist. Your role is to listen, believe, provide resources, and support. Don't try to fix everything yourself. Know when to refer to specialists. Maintain appropriate professional boundaries. Understand your jurisdiction's mandatory reporting requirements. Some professionals must report IPV to authorities. Know what you're required to report, to whom, and when. If mandatory reporting applies, explain this before disclosure. Balance legal obligations with survivor autonomy and safety as much as possible. Supporting IPV survivors can cause vicarious trauma. Practice self-care. Seek supervision and debriefing. Maintain boundaries. Connect with colleagues. Recognize your emotional responses. You can't support others effectively if you don't care for yourself. Preventing burnout ensures sustained, quality support. Your response to IPV disclosure can be transformative. A single supportive conversation can help someone recognize abuse, access resources, or begin their journey to safety. By applying trauma-informed principles and appropriate responses, you become part of the solution to intimate partner violence.
