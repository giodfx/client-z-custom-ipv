Congratulations on completing this comprehensive training on recognizing and responding to intimate partner violence. You've gained knowledge and skills that can make a real difference in survivors' lives. Let's review what we've covered and prepare for the final assessment. In Module One, you learned to recognize intimate partner violence in its many forms. You explored five types of abuse, studied the Power and Control Wheel, understood different IPV patterns, and applied your knowledge to the Sumpter case. Module Two deepened your understanding of sexual violence within intimate relationships. You learned consent principles, explored how rape culture enables violence, and recognized the unique dynamics and barriers surrounding intimate partner sexual assault. In Module Three, you developed response skills. You learned about IPV's multifaceted impacts, how to facilitate safety planning, and trauma-informed principles for supporting survivors. You now understand how to respond compassionately and effectively. Remember the key frameworks you've learned. The Power and Control Wheel for analyzing abusive dynamics. The Equality Wheel for healthy alternatives. The five principles of trauma-informed care. FRIES for understanding consent. These tools guide professional practice. Keep these critical concepts central to your practice. IPV is fundamentally about power and control. Abuse extends beyond physical violence. Leaving is extremely dangerous. Survivors' autonomy must be respected. Your trauma-informed response can change outcomes and save lives. The true value of this training comes from application. Use your knowledge to screen patients, recognize warning signs, respond supportively to disclosures, facilitate safety planning, and connect people to resources. You're now equipped to make a difference. The final assessment contains twenty questions covering all three modules. You'll need seventy percent to pass. Questions test your understanding of concepts, frameworks, and appropriate responses. If you don't pass initially, you can review materials and retake the assessment. This training is a beginning, not an endpoint. Continue learning through specialized IPV trainings, consultation with advocates, staying current on research, and reflecting on your practice. The National Domestic Violence Hotline and local organizations offer ongoing professional education. You now have the knowledge and tools to recognize and respond effectively to intimate partner violence. Your awareness, compassion, and appropriate action can help survivors find safety, access resources, and begin healing. Thank you for your commitment to ending intimate partner violence.
