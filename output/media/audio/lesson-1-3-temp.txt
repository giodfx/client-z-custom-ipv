The Duluth Model's Power and Control Wheel is one of the most important tools for understanding intimate partner violence. This framework reveals how abusers systematically use multiple tactics to dominate their partners. Intimidation creates an atmosphere of fear. Abusers use looks, actions, and gestures to frighten their partners. They may destroy property, harm beloved pets, or display weapons. The message is clear: obey or face consequences. Emotional abuse systematically destroys self-worth. Constant put-downs, name-calling, and humiliation erode confidence. Abusers make partners feel crazy through gaslighting and mind games. Over time, victims internalize these messages and doubt their own perceptions. Isolation cuts victims off from everyone who might help. Abusers control what partners do, see, read, and who they talk to. They may monitor all communications, limit transportation, or create conflicts with family and friends. Isolation makes victims dependent and removes witnesses. Abusers minimize their actions, deny abuse occurred, or shift blame to victims. They'll say it wasn't that bad, claim the victim is too sensitive, or insist the victim provoked them. This tactic makes victims doubt their experiences and feel responsible for abuse. When children are present, abusers weaponize them. They make partners feel guilty about the children, use visitation to harass, threaten to take children away, or manipulate children to relay messages. Children become tools for control and emotional leverage. Some abusers use traditional gender roles to justify control. They treat partners like servants, make all decisions, act as master of the house, and enforce rigid gender expectations. This tactic weaponizes cultural or religious beliefs to maintain dominance. Economic abuse creates complete financial dependence. Abusers prevent partners from working or getting education, control all money, don't allow access to family income, and may force victims to ask for money for basic needs. Financial control traps victims in relationships. Coercion and threats maintain control through fear. Abusers threaten to harm the victim, themselves, or loved ones. They threaten suicide, deportation, or reporting to child services. Some force partners to participate in illegal activities to create leverage. Threats keep victims compliant. At the wheel's center: physical and sexual violence. While not all abusive relationships involve physical violence, when present it's typically surrounded by these other control tactics. The wheel shows how multiple tactics work together to trap victims. The Equality Wheel presents a healthy contrast. In equal relationships, partners practice non-threatening behavior, mutual respect, trust, and honesty. They share responsibility, support each other's goals, negotiate fairly, and function as economic partners. This is the alternative to control. The Power and Control Wheel helps you see the full pattern. One tactic alone might be explained away. Multiple tactics used systematically reveal intimate partner violence. When you identify one spoke of the wheel, look for others. They're almost always present. This framework matters because it names the tactics abusers use. It validates survivors' experiences. It helps professionals identify patterns we might otherwise miss. And it clarifies that abuse is about power and control, not anger management or relationship problems. The Power and Control Wheel is now part of your professional toolkit. Use it to analyze relationships, recognize abuse patterns, and explain dynamics to colleagues. This evidence-based framework has helped millions understand what intimate partner violence really looks like.
