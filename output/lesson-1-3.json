    "narration": "Now we begin to see beneath the surface—where the iceberg's true mass lies. The Power and Control Wheel reveals the systematic nature of abuse, showing how seemingly separate behaviors connect into a coherent pattern of domination. Like the Duluth advocates who created this tool by listening to survivors, you'll learn to recognize the invisible architecture of control.",

        "content": "## A Tool for Recognition and Understanding\n\nIntimate partner violence service providers use a variety of tools to help survivors and perpetrators recognize and identify their experiences. One of the most common and powerful tools to aid survivors, service providers, and people who cause harm in describing and recognizing patterns of abuse is called the **Power and Control Wheel**.\n\n### Origins of the Wheel\n\nIn the early 1980s, Ellen Pence and her colleagues at the Domestic Abuse Intervention Project (DAIP) in Duluth, MN created the Power and Control Wheel. To create the model, Pence and the DAIP team interviewed survivors of intimate partner violence to identify their common experiences.\n\nPence and the Duluth team took great pains to document the most common abusive behaviors, or \"tactics,\" that were used against the women they interviewed. The wheel they created includes the tactics that were most universally experienced.\n\n**Important to Remember:**\n\nAs with all models, it is important to remember that not all survivors experience abuse in the same way, but that does not invalidate anyone's experience or mean that what they experienced is not abuse."

        "title": "Understanding the Wheel's Structure",
        "content": "## How to Use the Power and Control Wheel\n\nTo use the Power and Control Wheel, begin by familiarizing yourself with the individual components.\n\n### The Inner Sections\n\nOn the whole, the inside of the wheel contains **subtler, continual behaviors**, including:\n\n- **Using Intimidation:** Creating fear through looks, actions, gestures; destroying property; displaying weapons\n- **Using Emotional Abuse:** Putting someone down; making them feel bad about themselves; name-calling; making them think they're crazy\n- **Using Isolation:** Controlling what they do, who they see and talk to, what they read, where they go; limiting outside involvement\n- **Minimizing, Denying, and Blaming:** Making light of the abuse; saying it didn't happen; shifting responsibility; saying they caused it\n- **Using Children:** Making them feel guilty about the children; using children to relay messages; threatening to take children away\n- **Using Male Privilege:** Treating them like a servant; making all big decisions; acting like \"master of the castle\"\n- **Using Economic Abuse:** Preventing them from getting or keeping a job; taking their money; not letting them know about family income\n- **Using Coercion and Threats:** Making threats to hurt them; threatening to leave, commit suicide, or report them to authorities\n\n### The Outer Ring\n\nThe outer ring contains **more visible violence** such as physical and sexual assault.\n\n**How They Work Together:**\n\nThe violence depicted on the outside of the wheel often reinforces the regular use of the subtler methods of abuse shown on the inside of the wheel. When tactics on the inside of the wheel stop working, then the abuse may escalate to physical and sexual assault. The outer ring works as both a threat of escalation and as the end result of the escalation itself."

        "title": "The Threat Changes Everything",
        "content": "## From Unhealthy to Abusive\n\nYou'll notice some of the characteristics and behaviors that appear inside the wheel might occur in many relationships at varying degrees. The threat of physical and/or sexual violence, however, adds an emphasis to the other tactics that increase the likelihood of compliance by the partner being abused.\n\n**The Critical Difference:**\n\nThe very presence of the outer ring changes the dynamic from an unhealthy relationship behavior to abuse or intimate partner violence.\n\n### The Equality Wheel\n\nWe know people who cause harm can change, however. With this in mind, the Duluth Abuse Intervention Project created an **Equality Wheel** to accompany the Power and Control Wheel. The Equality Wheel shows the healthy behaviors that partners should use in their relationships instead of the controlling behaviors shown in the Power and Control Wheel.\n\n**Comparing the Wheels:**\n\nNotice how the healthy behaviors inside the Equality Wheel are reinforced by the non-violence on the outside of the wheel. Using the Equality Wheel to speak with survivors about intimate partner violence can help them see their experience in a different way—especially for individuals who are resistant to calling their experience abuse.\n\nBy seeing the healthy behaviors and actions next to the unhealthy ones in the Power and Control Wheel, survivors may have a breakthrough they may not have had otherwise when presented with the dichotomy of behaviors."

      "The Power and Control Wheel was created by interviewing survivors to identify the most common tactics used against them",
      "The inside of the wheel contains subtler, continual behaviors while the outer ring shows more visible physical and sexual violence",
      "The threat of physical/sexual violence transforms relationship behaviors from unhealthy to abusive",
      "When tactics inside the wheel stop working, abuse may escalate to physical and sexual assault",
      "The Equality Wheel shows healthy relationship behaviors as an alternative to the Power and Control Wheel",
      "Not all survivors experience abuse in the same way, but the wheel captures universally experienced patterns"

          "The inside shows legal behaviors while the outside shows illegal behaviors",
          "The inside shows subtler, continual behaviors while the outside shows more visible physical and sexual violence",

          "The inside shows accidental behaviors while the outside shows intentional behaviors"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "The INSIDE of the Power and Control Wheel contains subtler, continual behaviors like intimidation, isolation, and economic abuse. The OUTSIDE contains more visible violence such as physical and sexual assault. The outer ring reinforces the inner tactics—when the subtle methods stop working, abuse may escalate to physical violence. Understanding this structure helps professionals recognize that psychological abuse often precedes physical violence."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "The very presence of the THREAT of physical and/or sexual violence (the outer ring) changes the dynamic from unhealthy relationship behavior to abuse or intimate partner violence. While some behaviors inside the wheel might occur in many relationships at varying degrees, the threat of violence adds emphasis to the other tactics and increases the likelihood of compliance through fear. This is what distinguishes IPV from general relationship problems."

        "explanation": "The Duluth Project created the Equality Wheel to accompany the Power and Control Wheel because we know people who cause harm CAN change. The Equality Wheel shows the HEALTHY behaviors partners should use instead of controlling behaviors. Presenting both wheels together can help survivors see their experience differently and recognize what healthy relationships look like, which can be particularly helpful for those resistant to calling their experience abuse."
