Jill Davies teaches us that survivors are the experts on their own safety. Our role isn't to rescue—it's to support their autonomy, honor their wisdom, and help them regain the power and control that abuse took away.",

        "content": "## Safety Planning with Survivors\n\nOne way to help a survivor of intimate partner violence is through **safety planning**. A safety plan is a personalized, practical plan used to improve someone's safety while experiencing abuse, preparing to leave an abusive situation, or after leaving an abusive situation.\n\n### How to Support Safety Planning\n\nSee if you can help the survivor identify ways that they can increase their safety, and ask how you can be involved in that process.\n\n**Examples of how you might help:**\n\n- Can you provide them with a place to go if they need to leave?\n- Can you check in on them and use a codeword or phrase that lets you know if they are in danger?\n- Can you hold important documents or a bag with emergency supplies?\n- Can you help them identify safe people in their network?\n\n**Important principle:**\n\nTry to brainstorm ideas WITH the survivor and don't be afraid to reach out to a domestic violence advocate for help. Safety planning should be collaborative, not directive."

        "content": "## Intersectionality and Survivor's Needs\n\nRemember that every survivor of intimate partner violence will have different needs. The word **\"intersectionality\"** is often used to describe the intersecting identities every person holds, such as their:\n\n- Age\n- Race\n- Gender\n- Sexual orientation\n- Religion\n- Culture\n- Ability/disability\n- Immigration status\n- Socioeconomic status\n\n### Honoring Autonomy\n\nTo focus on each survivor's particular needs, we must understand that person's perspectives, culture, and resources.\n\n**A Critical Balance:**\n\nSometimes, it is easier to focus on the survivor's physical safety over letting them make decisions for themselves, but **that reinforces the lack of power and control the survivor has in their life**.\n\nIf the foundation of abuse is that a survivor has had their power and control taken away, then to resolve that, we must help the person regain that control in their life.\n\n**We want to promote the following in every survivor:**\n- Liberation\n- Autonomy\n- Self-determination"

        "content": "## Survivor Risk Analysis\n\nJill Davies, deputy director of Greater Hartford Legal Aid, emphasizes the need to focus on more than just a survivor's physical safety. In Davies' Victim-Defined Safety Planning Summary, she states that **\"The spiritual, social, and emotional aspects of our humanity are also necessary for security.\"**\n\n### Three Elements Survivors Consider When Assessing Safety Strategies:\n\n1. **No violence** - Freedom from physical and sexual assault\n2. **Basic human needs** - Food, shelter, financial security\n3. **Social and emotional well-being** - Connection, self-esteem, autonomy\n\n### Life-Generated Risks\n\nIn addition to the risks associated with their abusive partner, a survivor must also consider their **life-generated risks**—risks in their life that they may have no control over such as:\n\n- Health issues\n- Financial concerns\n- Social supports\n- Immigration status\n- Custody concerns\n- Employment stability\n\n## Reevaluating \"Safety\"\n\nWhen deciding if a survivor is \"safe,\" we often look at whether or not they are free from the abuse of their partner. It is important to remember, however, that a survivor's safety also includes their social and emotional needs.\n\n### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs\n\nIn 1943, psychologist Abraham Maslow outlined what is now called **Maslow's hierarchy of needs**, which identifies the five \"needs\" that drive human behavior:\n\n1. **Physiological** (bottom) - Food, water, sleep, shelter\n2. **Safety** - Security, employment, health\n3. **Belonging** - Friendship, family, intimacy\n4. **Esteem** - Respect, recognition, confidence\n5. **Self-actualization** (top) - Achieving full potential\n\nMaslow argues that to get to the top of the pyramid (self-fulfillment), you first need to satisfy everything below it.\n\n### Safety Beyond Physical Security\n\nWhen we talk about safety and survivors of intimate partner violence, it's easy for us to think once a survivor reaches the second level of this pyramid, then they are safe and no longer require help. But for a survivor to truly find safety, they must be more than just physically safe.\n\n**According to Dr. Jacqueline Campbell:**\n\n\"A survivor who is no longer hit by their partner but cannot feed her children or pay her bills **isn't safe**, nor is she safe if she is still suffering from the effects of trauma.\"\n\n### True Safety Means:\n\n- **No violence** - Physical and sexual safety\n- **Basic needs are met** - Food, shelter, financial security\n- **Social and emotional well-being** - Connection, healing, self-esteem\n\nWe also want survivors to achieve emotional safety, make social connections, and recognize their strengths.\n\nIf the foundation of abuse is that a survivor has had their power and control taken away, then to resolve that, we must help the person regain that control in their life."

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "According to Jill Davies, survivors consider three elements: (1) NO VIOLENCE, (2) BASIC HUMAN NEEDS, and (3) SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. This framework recognizes that safety is more than just the absence of violence—it encompasses having basic needs met (food, shelter, financial security) and experiencing social/emotional wellbeing (connection, self-esteem, autonomy). True safety planning must address all three elements."

        "options": [
          "Because physical safety is not important",

          "Because physical safety and decision-making are unrelated"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Focusing only on physical safety while taking away decision-making power REINFORCES THE LACK OF POWER AND CONTROL the survivor has in their life. If the foundation of abuse is that a survivor has had their power and control taken away, then to resolve that, we must help them REGAIN that control. This is why we promote liberation, autonomy, and self-determination—even when it's difficult or scary. Trauma-informed support honors survivor choice."

          "When they have left the relationship"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "According to Dr. Campbell, a survivor is truly safe when there is NO VIOLENCE, their BASIC NEEDS ARE MET, AND they experience SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. Simply not being hit is not enough—if a survivor cannot feed their children, pay bills, or is still suffering from trauma effects, they are NOT safe. This comprehensive view of safety helps us provide more complete, trauma-informed support that addresses all aspects of a survivor's wellbeing."
