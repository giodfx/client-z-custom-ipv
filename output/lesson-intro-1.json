        "content": "## What is Intimate Partner Violence (IPV)?\n\nIntimate Partner Violence (IPV) is defined slightly differently depending on who is using the term. For this course, we will use the House of Ruth Maryland standard definition, which focuses on the experience of the survivor and addresses the survivor's need for support and services.\n\n**Two Critical Elements:**\n\nThe two most important elements to remember about the definition of intimate partner violence are:\n\n1. **It is a pattern of behaviors** - not isolated incidents\n2. **There is a power imbalance** between the intimate partners—one partner holds some power over the other\n\n### IPV vs. Domestic Violence\n\nMore commonly, you will hear the term \"domestic violence\" used when talking about intimate partner violence, but it is important to remember that **not all partners live together** and **not all violence in a home is between partners**.\n\nThe term \"intimate partner\" refers to any intimate relationship between people:\n- Long-term or short-term\n- Formal or casual\n- Public or private\n- Serious or not\n\n### Who Is Affected\n\nIntimate partner violence can happen to **anyone** regardless of:\n- Race\n- Age  \n- Sexual orientation\n- Religion\n- Ability\n- Gender\n\n### Forms of IPV\n\nIt can take many forms, including:\n- Physical abuse\n- Sexual abuse\n- Emotional abuse\n- Economic abuse\n- Psychological abuse\n\n### Broader Impact\n\nIPV impacts individuals, families, workplaces, and communities. Since intimate partner violence is framed within the global issue of violence against women, it is shaped and supported by societal, familial, and cultural norms and is complicated by the intersection of other cultural oppressions."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "The term 'intimate partner violence' is more precise because it recognizes that not all intimate partners cohabitate (they may be dating, in casual relationships, etc.), and 'domestic' violence could refer to other family violence that isn't between intimate partners. IPV specifically describes violence between intimate partners regardless of living situation."
